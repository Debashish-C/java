Project Idea: Smart Campus Management System (SCMS)
ðŸ‘‰ Why this?
Solves a real-world problem.
Covers end-to-end system design (backend + frontend + DB + APIs).
Involves scalability, security, design patterns, and Java frameworks.
Can be expanded later into a microservices or cloud-native project.
Recruiters will love it since it shows you can handle a production-grade application.
ðŸ“„ Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for Smart Campus Management System (SCMS)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The SCMS aims to provide a unified platform for students, faculty, and administrators to manage academic, administrative, and communication tasks within a university campus.
1.2 Scope
Students can register for courses, track attendance, view grades, pay fees, and access resources.
Faculty can manage courses, upload materials, track attendance, and grade students.
Admins can manage users, fees, and campus-wide notices.
A secure, scalable system built with Java Spring Boot for backend and React/Angular for frontend.
1.3 Technologies
Backend: Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate/JPA, Spring Security, JWT)
Frontend: React.js (or Angular if you prefer Java full-stack vibe with Spring)
Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL
APIs: RESTful APIs + Swagger Docs
Caching: Redis (for session & performance)
Messaging Queue (optional, advanced): Kafka/RabbitMQ (for async event handling, e.g., notifications)
Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes (cloud-ready, resume booster)
Testing: JUnit, Mockito
CI/CD: GitHub Actions / Jenkins
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Student Module
Register/Login (JWT authentication)
Profile management
Course registration & withdrawal
Attendance tracking
Grade viewing
Fee payment (integrate Razorpay/Stripe dummy API)
Chatbot for FAQs (AI integration optional)
2.2 Faculty Module
Login & role-based access
Course creation & syllabus upload
Attendance marking
Grade submission
Upload study materials & announcement
2.3 Admin Module
User management (students, faculty)
Course catalog management
Fee structure management
Generate reports (attendance, fee defaulters, top performers)
System logs & monitoring
2.4 Additional Features (Advanced)
Notification system (via email/SMS/push)
Discussion forum (like a mini StackOverflow inside campus)
Library management (track issued books, fines)
Cloud file storage (upload notes/assignments to AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage)
AI Recommendation (recommend courses/materials based on student performance)
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: Support 10,000+ concurrent users.
Performance: API response < 200ms.
Security: JWT-based authentication, role-based access, encryption (BCrypt for passwords).
Reliability: 99.9% uptime with clustering support.
Usability: Responsive UI, mobile-first design.
4. System Design
Architecture: Microservice-oriented or monolithic to start â†’ scalable to microservices.
Modules: Authentication, Course Management, Fee Management, Notification Service.
Database Schema (simplified):
Users (id, name, email, role, password_hash)
Courses (id, name, credits, faculty_id)
Enrollments (student_id, course_id, grade)
Attendance (student_id, course_id, date, status)
Fees (student_id, amount, status)
5. Tools & Requirements
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
Build Tool: Maven / Gradle
Version Control: Git + GitHub/GitLab
Database: PostgreSQL
Server: Tomcat (embedded in Spring Boot)
Containerization: Docker
Optional: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logs
6. Learning Outcomes for You
Strong Java + Spring Boot mastery (industry standard).
REST API design & documentation.
Authentication & Authorization with JWT.
Database modeling with JPA/Hibernate.
CI/CD pipelines for deployment.
Scalable architecture with caching & queues.
Exposure to Docker, Kubernetes & cloud deployments.
Full-stack exposure if you add frontend (React/Angular).
âœ… This project will brighten your resume because:
Itâ€™s large-scale, real-world, multi-user, secure, and scalable.
Uses Java + Spring Boot (backend), which is gold standard in enterprise development.
Shows system design thinking (scalability, security, modularity).
Youâ€™ll learn a ton about production-level apps.
